export const tribonacci = (position) => {
  // Implement a function that returns the Nth element of a tribonacci sequence

  // The positions start counting from one (not zero-based numbering)
  // The first three elements of the sequence are: 1, 1, 1

  // The Nth element is the sum of the last three numbers:
  // ElementN = Element(N-1) + Element(N-2) + Element(N-3)

  // Example of the sequence: 1, 1, 1, 3, 5, 9, 17, 31 ...

  // If the element is not positive or is not present throw an error
  // The tests are correct, have fun!
